The program is called ClassAssignmentOrganizer. The target audience is University of Arizona students.
The purpose of this program allows students to organize their files into folders without needing to
copy, paste, or navigate their computer to a bunch of different subfolders just to organize their work.
This program will use addresses of folders and files then organizes them based on user preference.

The only requirements to run this program is: java runtime environment 17

When launching the program, a window will pop up with some choice boxes and textFields.
The names and prompts are for ease of use and the user can understand how the program works from it.

- If the create directory option is selected, the only two text fields the user needs to enter is the
  name that they are creating and the directory address they want to put it in. This allows for the user
  to customize where they want their files to be stored.

- If the existing directory option is enabled, all but the first two options need to be selected. This will include
  the file name that you want to move, the address of the directory the file is stored in, the address of the
  directory you previously created, and the type of subfolder you will put it in.

(The program will not break when these fields are empty)

- After the fields/choice boxes are filled out. Hit the submit button and the program will organize your file.

Future ideas for this program is including a way to transfer all items in an existing folder and creating subfolders
for each class to increase customizability.
